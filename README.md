So you've found this repository, welcome!
Just know that this is a work in progress. 

If you want to know how formulas are implemented, then look at `functions.R`
If you want to see how functions are applied, check out `PAA_prep.R`

We will be iterating in the coming months, so nothing is final at this stage.
Some transformation functions can go in both directions-- of these, some are calibrated (exact) and others are not, YMMV
